# Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems's Project
Projects developed as part of the Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems Master's course at Politecnico di Torino.
Full details on the development and implementation are provided in the two accompanying PDF reports.

## Running Individual Tasks

To execute each task individually, simply run the corresponding `taskN.m` script located in the respective subfolder:

Replace `N` with the task number (1 to 5).


## Running Maglev Project

- To run the **maglev project** using a **predefined configuration**, execute project_single_run.m

- To run the project across **multiple configurations** and evaluate their impact, use project_multiple_run.m

Both files run the configuration on both the regulator. Their models are defined in the `sim/` subfolder.
